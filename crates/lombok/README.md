# `lombokrs`

`lombokrs`(`Lombok` Rust) is a lightweight Rust macro library. It is the simple implementation of `Lombok` Java in Rust.

## Acknowledgment

This project, `lombokrs`, was developed with significant inspiration from the open-source project `lombok-rs`. Special
thanks to the contributors of [lombok-rs](https://github.com/sokomishalov/lombok-rs) for their excellent work,
particularly in handling `Lifetimes`. While
building upon their foundation, I have made several modifications based on my understanding, especially in the areas of
Builder and Getter implementations.
